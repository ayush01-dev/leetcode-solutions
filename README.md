# LeetCode Solutions in C++

This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems solved using C++.

## Structure
- Each problem is organized in its own folder, named with the problem number and title.
- Each folder contains:
  - The C++ solution file (`.cpp`)
  - A `README.md` with a brief description of the problem and approach

## How to Use
- Browse the folders to find solutions to specific problems.
- Each solution is self-contained and can be compiled and run independently.

## Example
```
0075-sort-colors/
    0075-sort-colors.cpp
    README.md
```

## Contribution
Feel free to fork the repository and add your own solutions!
